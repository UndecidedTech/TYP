computer science is a shitty name -- we take as much 
as we know about how the world works, and make it software

science is asking questions about how the world works

certain problems cannot be solved by computer problems

Non-english speakers call it informatics

Computer programming is easy when the program is small
-- it can all fit in your head at once

There was a time where programs could fit in your head...

Computer science is about the control of complexity
 -- the old fashioned answer, hire 5000 programs
   - this doesn't work because it takes even longer
 -- separate problems and programs into separate chunks
  - these are called programming paradigms

APPLICATION
-----------
HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE (eg. scheme)
-----------
Low level language (eg. C)
-----------
Machine language/architecture
-----------
Logic gates
-----------
transistors
-----------
Quantum physics


High level languages will abstract where values are in memory

low level languages are interpreted in ways the computer can understand


Function:
f(x) = 2x + 6

Computers are doing more than one thing at a time -- time sharing allows computers
to run thinks for one 10th of a second and then another thing

If your program is entirely made of functions, it won't know what the larger state of things
in the computer are.

functional programming became important because of paralellism

f(x) = 2x + 6
g(x) = 2(x + 3)

these are the same functions, different procedures

inside the computer, there are only procedures

2x + b -- this isn't a function because it has a free variable

Its a lot easier to make a program that works, and make it faster
than to make a fast program that doesn't work, work..
